# Image Optimization Summary

This document summarizes the image optimizations implemented for the K2AE Engineering Solutions website to improve loading performance.

## Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Width and Height Attributes
Added explicit width and height attributes to all `<img>` tags to prevent layout shift and improve Core Web Vitals (CWV) scores.

**Files Updated:**
- partials/header.html
- index.html
- pages/about.html
- pages/portfolio.html

**Benefits:**
- Prevents Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
- Reserves space for images before they load
- Improves perceived loading performance

### 2. Lazy Loading
Implemented lazy loading for images below the fold using the `loading="lazy"` attribute.

**Files Updated:**
- index.html (about section image)
- pages/about.html (team image)
- pages/portfolio.html (all portfolio images)

**Benefits:**
- Reduces initial page load time
- Saves bandwidth for users
- Improves Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) score

### 3. Responsive Images with srcset
Added `srcset` attributes to enable the browser to select appropriately sized images based on device screen resolution.

**Files Updated:**
- partials/header.html
- index.html
- pages/about.html
- pages/portfolio.html

**Benefits:**
- Serves appropriately sized images for different devices
- Reduces data usage for mobile users
- Improves loading performance on smaller screens

### 4. WebP Format Optimization
Created a guide for converting images to WebP format for better compression while maintaining quality.

**Files Updated:**
- WEBP_CONVERSION_GUIDE.md

**Benefits:**
- 25-35% smaller file sizes compared to PNG
- Better quality at same file size
- Modern image format support in most browsers

### 5. CSS Optimizations
Added CSS transitions and JavaScript handling for smoother image loading experience.

**Files Updated:**
- css/style-new.css
- js/script.js

**Benefits:**
- Smooth fade-in effect for lazy-loaded images
- Better visual feedback during loading
- Enhanced user experience

## Performance Impact

These optimizations will result in:
- Reduced initial page load time
- Lower bandwidth usage
- Improved Core Web Vitals scores
- Better user experience on mobile devices
- Faster loading on slower network connections

## Next Steps

To fully realize the benefits of these optimizations, follow the WebP conversion guide to convert all PNG images to WebP format and update the HTML to use the WebP images with PNG fallbacks using the `<picture>` element.
